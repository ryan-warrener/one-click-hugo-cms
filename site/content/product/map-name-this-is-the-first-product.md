name: Best of Argentina & Brazil
day:
  - overview: Bienvenido! Welcome to Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires is the ultimate
      cosmopolitan city, with Latin passion, European elegance, and its own
      distinctive style. Your adventure begins with an important welcome meeting
      at 6 pm. Your leader will leave a note at the hotel reception telling you
      where this important meeting will take place. If you arrive early, why not
      visit San Telmo and its weekend antiques market and artists' displays –
      it's a great chance to acquaint yourself with some portenos (local
      residents). Alternatively, visit Recoleta (the grand cemetery) or perhaps
      Casa Rosada (the Pink House).
